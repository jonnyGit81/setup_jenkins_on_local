=== JFrog
https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Installing+on+Windows[Jfrog setup]

or
https://devops4solutions.com/jfrog-artifactory-download-installation/[Jfrog Setup]

https://bintray.com/jfrog/artifactory/jfrog-artifactory-oss-zip/4.15.0[Download Jfrog]

Setup Jfrog
https://devops4solutions.com/jfrog-artifactory-download-installation/

- Extract the zip file
- run / click the */bin/artifactory.bat*
- Go to the browser and visit localhost:8081 in order to visit to the artifactory in browser.
- Log in as admin by providing the default credentials:

    Username: admin
    Password: password

- You can create a Local repository to store package files created by the Jenkins/Maven project:
Go to Admin -> Repositories ->Local -> New

    . Select maven
    . Provide key (name: Jenkins-integration) for your repository and check Handle Release and deselect Handle Snapshot
    . Similarly create another local repository with key (e.g. Jenkins-snapshot) and check Handle Snapshot while deselecting Handle Release.
    . Also, create a user that you can utilize from Jenkins to access Artifactory:
Go to admin -> Security -> users -> Click on NEW from Users management window -> Add new user->Save
    . Furthermore, provide the newly created user with permissions to the repositories:

    Firstly, go to admin -> security-> permission

    Secondly, give the name to the permission

    Lastly, choose the repositories on which you want to set the permission
    (jenkins-integration and jenkins-snapshot)

    Click save & finish

== Jenkins integration with JFrog Artifactory
https://devops4solutions.com/jenkins-jfrog-artifactory-integration/

Step II. Artifactory Plugin configuration in Jenkins

a. Go to Jenkins dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available -> Artifactory -> Install without restart.

b. Configure Artifactory-related settings in Jenkins:

Go to Jenkins dashboard -> Configure System ->Artifactory section ->Add artifactory server -> provide the details -> Test the connection ->apply & save


d. Go to a Jenkins project that creates a package file after compiling all of the source files.

e. Go to Build Environment section -> Resolve artifacts from artifactory -> Click on refresh Repositories ->select the repository in release and snapshot field from the lists.

c. Go to a Jenkins project that creates a package file after compiling all of the source files.

Go to Build Environment section -> Resolve artifacts from artifactory -> Click on refresh Repositories ->select the repository in release and snapshot field from the lists.


d. Go to Add post-build section ->select deploy artifacts to artifactory -> click on refresh -> choose the target releases and snapshot repository (repositories created earlier) ->save


e. Click on Build now and verify logs in the Console Output. Jar files are resolved from the local repository or Artifactory.

f. Once the package is created, it is stored in artifactory too. Go in the artifactory and check the package.
